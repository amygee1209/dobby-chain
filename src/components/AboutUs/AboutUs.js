          DobbyChain is a blockchain based P2P token trading platform. 
          Founded in Fall 2020, DobbyChain has become the ultimate platform for 
          KSEA members to manage their club activities and most importantly, 
          to get concrete incentives for their participation. Our technical approach 
          to incentivization through a unique, custom ERC-20 token is unparalleled. 
          We work with exceptional talent from UC Berkeley across different fields 
          ranging from computer science & EECS to economics and business.
